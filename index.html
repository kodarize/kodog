      <h5>A Look At Humans Interfacing With Technology Through Gestures, Nov 20, 2023</h5>
      <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E12AQEor_pP6cx5tg/article-cover_image-shrink_423_752/0/1696250299583?e=1706140800&v=beta&t=iI1Nih_G-0upJAPmzjFFPGAN4Zt73pkHsTW-zCm_DkI" alt="Gestures">
      <p>Gestures. Are they the future of how we interact with our devices? Let's take this gesture for instance. I like to call it the pinch. Touch your index finger to your thumb. You can do it once, twice, or multiple times in a row. These two fingers, this one gesture, is being used by many tech companies and in many tech products as of late. Now gestures aren't something new, but the way they've been implemented as of late show some potential.</p>
      <p>Let's take the Apple watch for instance. Many of Apple's smartwatches support a feature where double tapping your thumb with your index finger will select whatever is on the screen. They say that this comes in handy when your hands are full or if something is keeping you from using the touch screen or buttons.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Apple. Their upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset also uses gestures. "Tapping the thumb and the index finger together signals to the headset that you want to tap on a virtual element on the display that you're looking at. Users have also described this as a pinch, and it is the equivalent to tapping on the screen of an iPhone ... Tapping twice initiates a double tap gesture ... A pinch and a hold is similar to a tap and hold gesture, and it does things like highlighting text ... Pinching and dragging can be used to scroll and to move windows around. You can scroll horizontally or vertically, and if you move your hand faster, you'll be able to scroll faster ... You can pinch your fingers together and pull your hands apart to zoom in, and presumably zooming out will have a pushing sort of motion. Window sizes can also be adjusted by dragging at the corners ... Rotate is the other two-handed gesture and based on Apple's chart, it will involve pinching the fingers together and rotating the hands to manipulate virtual objects" (Mutabazi, 2023).</p>
      <p>Now, Apple isn't the only company using this gesture. There is a company called Humane that has created a product they call the AI Pin, which is a seven hundred dollar device that allows you to make calls, take pictures, listen to music and podcasts, and ask questions using only your voice and gestures. It also projects lasers onto the user hand instead of using a screen. Again, like with the apple devices, to make a selection just touch your index finger to your thumb.</p>
      <p>Finally, one more product. Xpanceo is a company working a simple contact lens with a built in display, sensors, and other components that give the user a wide array of applications including night vision and zooming. How is it controlled. Well, the company says that it is controlled with gaze commands. Now, while this product in the works may not use gestures at the moment, imagine what it would be like if it could.</p>
      <p>Companies have tried many alternatives to touch screen, keyboards, and mice including stuff like voice commands and eye tracking. However, I see potential in the use of gesture based controls. Gestures can transcend language, like pointing and waving. Plus, gestures are more discrete and can be used in situations where one should stay quite (like at the movies). Overall, I can see many use cases for gestures, and it might just be the future of interfacing with technology.</p>
      <P>Also, here is a funny Reddit post:</P>

        <ul>
          <li>Have a backup vehicle</li>

          <li>While one might not want to help competition, if your business is non-operational, it may be best to work with competition and redirect customers to said competition to make customers happy (like how Macy's used to tell their customers where they could find the lowest price items, even if those lower prices were at competition stores).</li>

      <h2>Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Feature</h2>
      <h5>Cisco's IOS XE Software Web UI has been exploited (10/10 Critical), Oct 23, 2023</h5>
      <p>Many are considering any Cisco IOS XE device with it's web interface exposed to the public internet to be compromised and replaced. Here is the HTTP POST code being used:</p>
      <img src="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/content/images/2023/10/data-src-image-a4c125f3-cbfc-4a3d-a1f0-1e140c1039c9.png" alt="Meteor Lake">
      <p>The implant is based on the Lua programming language and consists of 29 lines of code that facilitates the arbitrary command execution. The attacker must create an HTTP POST request to the device, which delivers the following three functions (Figure 1):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first function is dictated by the "menu" parameter, which must exist and must be non-empty. This returns a string of numbers surrounded by forward-slashes, which we believe represents the implant’s version. </li>
        <li>The second function is dictated by the "logon_hash" parameter, which must be set to "1". This returns an 18-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant.</li>
        <li>The third function is also dictated by the "logon_hash" parameter, which checks to see if the parameter matches a 40-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant. A second parameter used here is "common_type", which must be non-empty, and whose value determines whether the code is executed at the system level or IOS level. If the code is executed at the system level, this parameter must be set to "subsystem", and if it is executed at the IOS level, the parameter must be "iox". The IOX commands are executed at privilege level 15.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In most instances we have observed of this implant being installed, both the 18-character hexadecimal string in the second function and the 40-character hexadecimal string in the third function are unique, although in some cases, these strings were the same across different devices. This suggests there is a way for the actor to compute the value used in the third function from the value returned by the second function, acting as a form of authentication required for the arbitrary command execution provided in the third function.</p>
      <p>We have also observed a second version of the implant, which now includes a preliminary check for the HTTP Authorization header.  Most of the core functionalities of this version remain the same as the previous version (Figure 2). The second version likely started to be deployed as early as October 20, and was deployed using the earlier version of the implant.</p>

      <p>Intel's newest "Meteor Lake" generation (known officially as the Intel Core Ultra) is set to launch on December 14th, and with it comes a lot of firsts and new stuff for Intel. There is a lot to go over, so I'll break it up.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Industry Leading Wifi 6E & Wifi 7 Support</li>
        <li>Industry Leading FOVEROS 3D packaging</li>
        <li>Industry Leading Thunderbolt 4</li>
        <li>Latest connectivity PCIe Gen5</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> Intel Arc Graphics</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> Media & Display standards</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> Low power island E-cores</li>
        <li><b>FIRST</b> Built-in NPU AI engine</li>
        <li><b>FIRST</b> 3D performance hybrid architecture</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> P-core and E-core microarchitectures</li>
        <li><b>FIRST</b> Chip built on Intel 4 process technology</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>FOVEROS</h3>
      <p>Intels new chips are being built on the new Intel 4 process node, using industry leading FOVEROS 3D Packaging, and are built out of Lego-like building blocks where "the 'CPU' and 'GPU' aren’t just separate components on the same chip, for example, but actually separate pieces of silicon printed at different sizes and grafted together. The likes of AMD and Qualcomm have been doing this for a while, but heterogeneous computing is relatively new to Intel" (Hollister, 2023). Here are some videos from Intel explaining FOVEROS:</p>

      <h3>Glass Substraits</h3>
      <p>Intel is planning on using glass substrates instead of resin substrates for their chips to prevent warping and other problems from heat. Here is a video of Intel explaining their use of glass substrates:</p>

      <h3>NPU AI Engine</h3>
      <p>Finally, Intel is introducing a new NPU AI Engine, which Windows can natively see and monitor in the Task Manager:</p>
