      <h2>Contingency Plans</h2>
      <h5>Here are stories about contingency plans, Nov 13, 2023</h5>
      <p>For today's post, I asked ChatGPT the following: I need stories about businesses in Maine, USA with the moral and theme of the stories being the importance of contingency plans, and how no matter how much planning one does, the unexpected things will always be what causes problems (so one should even have plans of what to do when the unexpected happens). For help with these stories, use the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delivery: What if your delivery software stops working?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Have backup delivery solutions</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Delivery: Vehicles</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a backup vehicle</li>
          <li>Schedule deliveries so that there is always an extra vehicle</li>
          <li>What to do about fuel</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Backup phone / communication</li>
        <ul>
          <li>CB radios</li>
          <li>walkie-talkies</li>
          <li>landline</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Money / Finances</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple payment options</li>
          <li>Multiple accounts</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Employee shortages</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Hire temps</li>
          <li>Have a temp agency</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Machinery and tools</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Have backup machinery and tools</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Power</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Generators</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Risk versus reward</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce the consequences of failure</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The unknown, if all else fails</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Have an easy way to close the business temporarily if needed, and have an automated voice messaging system to tell customers that the business can't operate, when it may return to full operation, and alternatives.</li>
          <li>While one might not want to help competition, if your business is non-operational, it may be best to work with competition and redirect customers to said competition to make customers happy (like how Macy's used to tell their customers where they could find the lowest price items, even if those lower prices were at competition stores).</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2>AdGuard Home vs. Pi-Hole</h2>
      <h5>Comparing Ad Blockers, Oct 30, 2023</h5>
      <p>"AdGuard Home and Pi-hole are two popular options for blocking ads and trackers while browsing the web. Both offer basic features such as the ability to add blocklists and a built-in DHCP server, all without requiring a resource-hogging browser extension or background application to monitor your network traffic.

      <h2>Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Feature</h2>
      <h5>Cisco's IOS XE Software Web UI has been exploited (10/10 Critical), Oct 23, 2023</h5>
      <p>Many are considering any Cisco IOS XE device with it's web interface exposed to the public internet to be compromised and replaced. Here is the HTTP POST code being used:</p>
      <img src="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/content/images/2023/10/data-src-image-a4c125f3-cbfc-4a3d-a1f0-1e140c1039c9.png" alt="Meteor Lake">
      <p>The implant is based on the Lua programming language and consists of 29 lines of code that facilitates the arbitrary command execution. The attacker must create an HTTP POST request to the device, which delivers the following three functions (Figure 1):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first function is dictated by the "menu" parameter, which must exist and must be non-empty. This returns a string of numbers surrounded by forward-slashes, which we believe represents the implant’s version. </li>
        <li>The second function is dictated by the "logon_hash" parameter, which must be set to "1". This returns an 18-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant.</li>
        <li>The third function is also dictated by the "logon_hash" parameter, which checks to see if the parameter matches a 40-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant. A second parameter used here is "common_type", which must be non-empty, and whose value determines whether the code is executed at the system level or IOS level. If the code is executed at the system level, this parameter must be set to "subsystem", and if it is executed at the IOS level, the parameter must be "iox". The IOX commands are executed at privilege level 15.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In most instances we have observed of this implant being installed, both the 18-character hexadecimal string in the second function and the 40-character hexadecimal string in the third function are unique, although in some cases, these strings were the same across different devices. This suggests there is a way for the actor to compute the value used in the third function from the value returned by the second function, acting as a form of authentication required for the arbitrary command execution provided in the third function.</p>
      <p>We have also observed a second version of the implant, which now includes a preliminary check for the HTTP Authorization header.  Most of the core functionalities of this version remain the same as the previous version (Figure 2). The second version likely started to be deployed as early as October 20, and was deployed using the earlier version of the implant.</p>

      <h2>Meteor Lake: Tiles, Cores, and Nodes (REVISITED)</h2>
      <h5>New Intel Chip & Chip Making Process, Oct 16, 2023</h5>
      <img src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1937x980/1440x729/filters:focal(969x490:970x491):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24933955/mtl.jpg" alt="Meteor Lake">
      <p>Intel's newest "Meteor Lake" generation (known officially as the Intel Core Ultra) is set to launch on December 14th, and with it comes a lot of firsts and new stuff for Intel. There is a lot to go over, so I'll break it up.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Industry Leading Wifi 6E & Wifi 7 Support</li>
        <li>Industry Leading FOVEROS 3D packaging</li>
        <li>Industry Leading Thunderbolt 4</li>
        <li>Latest connectivity PCIe Gen5</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> Intel Arc Graphics</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> Media & Display standards</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> Low power island E-cores</li>
        <li><b>FIRST</b> Built-in NPU AI engine</li>
        <li><b>FIRST</b> 3D performance hybrid architecture</li>
        <li><b>NEW</b> P-core and E-core microarchitectures</li>
        <li><b>FIRST</b> Chip built on Intel 4 process technology</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>FOVEROS</h3>
      <p>Intels new chips are being built on the new Intel 4 process node, using industry leading FOVEROS 3D Packaging, and are built out of Lego-like building blocks where "the 'CPU' and 'GPU' aren’t just separate components on the same chip, for example, but actually separate pieces of silicon printed at different sizes and grafted together. The likes of AMD and Qualcomm have been doing this for a while, but heterogeneous computing is relatively new to Intel" (Hollister, 2023). Here are some videos from Intel explaining FOVEROS:</p>

      <h3>Glass Substraits</h3>
      <p>Intel is planning on using glass substrates instead of resin substrates for their chips to prevent warping and other problems from heat. Here is a video of Intel explaining their use of glass substrates:</p>

      <h3>NPU AI Engine</h3>
      <p>Finally, Intel is introducing a new NPU AI Engine, which Windows can natively see and monitor in the Task Manager:</p>
